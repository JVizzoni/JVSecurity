/*
 Design Intentions:
 ------------------
 1) First and foremost, this keychain wrapper is designed to encourage and make it simple for users to follow standard security procedures. Specifically, it should provide a simple interface for storing *SALT & HASHED* passwords. If you would like to learn more about why you should salt and hash your passwords, ask Linked In.
 2) It should interface seemlessly with the other classes in JVSecurity to salt, hash, and store your data.
 3) It should provide a simple wrapper for the Keychain C API.
